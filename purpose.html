          <p>
            Our itenerary here at Don't Worry, Bee Happy, is to assist with the endangerment of bees through merchandise patron system. More specifically, the rusty-patched bumblebee. The bumblebee population has plummeted drastically throughout the past two decades, especially in southern Ontario (our temporary targeted geographical area). They are an integral component of our ecosystem. Setting aside the production of delicious honey, they are responsible for the pollination of flowers and plants. Their ecological presence ensures the reproduction of all kinds of plants. In terms of culture, they bring about harmony in nature through flowers and nectar.

            Historically, the Rusty-patched Bumble Bee was widespread and common in eastern North America, reaching the northern limit of its range in southern Ontario and southwestern Quebec. The species has since suffered rapid and severe decline. Since 2002, the only known occurrence of the Rusty-patched Bumble Bee in Canada is at Pinery Provincial Park in Huron County, Ontario. The most prominent threats to the Rusty-patched Bumble Bee include the use of systemic pesticides, the spread of diseases from domestic bumblebees (used as pollinators in greenhouses) to wild bumblebees, and habitat loss. - Provincial Government of Ontario ESA (The Endangered Species Act, 2007)
