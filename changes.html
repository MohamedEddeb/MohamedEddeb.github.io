          <p>
            The initial design for the website was to capture our mission as best as possible. This was going to be done through a sequential layout. The sequences were divided somewhat like a presentation which we deemed to be unfit in terms of creating an effective website. After the sequences we would have had to create three separate menus regardless which lead us to our new design.
          </p>
            The implemented design is a simplistic one. It captures all the features we initially intended to capture in our sequential canvas. Instead of breaking down the issue of the endangerment of bees on separate pages, we condensed them in accordance with the coherent page. On the home page, we briefly introduce the subject with many images and little text. It is open concept and simplistic to intrigue the visitor. Instead of a “help” page, we renamed it “purpose”. On this page we captured our mission as well as a detailed description of the subject. Lastly, the shop page purely focuses on our provided services (pledges).

            <p>
              - The new design offers a more condensed yet efficient experience. It is cleaner and more simplistic. It does not sacrifice the presentational layout.
